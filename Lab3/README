Through this lab, I have become familiar with volume rendering. At the end, I have gained the following competencies: • Understanding of a 3D graphics basic engine and the render pipeline. • Implementation and manipulation of a ray-marching fragment shader. • Understand and implement the Emission-Absorption Model of the Volume Rendering Equation.
