First and second labs of ACG. The first lab has the objective of getting familiar with the basic concepts of ray tracing. At the end, I gained the following competencies: how to set up a scene, how to extract relevant geometric information and display it on the screen, how to apply ray tracing to compute Phong Illumination (with shadows) with a point light source, implement mirror and transmissive materials. In the second lab implement a basic I have implemented a Ray Tracing path tracer. At the end, I have gained the following competencies: how to implement a basic Path Tracer, estimate via Monte Carlo integration the rendering integral in its hemispherical formulation and area formulation in the context of direct lighting, efficiently compute the indirect illumination by applying Next Event Estimation (NEE).
